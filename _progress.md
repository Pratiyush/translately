### Deliverables

- [x] `_reference/` read-only third-party reference sources cloned, gitignored
- [x] Top-level docs: README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, RELEASE-NOTES, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CODEOWNERS, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md
- [x] `.gitignore` at repo root
- [x] `.kiro/steering/` — architecture, contributing-rules, api-conventions, ui-conventions
- [x] `tasks.md` + `_progress.md` Kiro trackers
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` + `infra/` scaffold — Postgres 16, Redis 7, MinIO, Mailpit
- [x] Gradle KDSL skeleton — `settings.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, 13 empty modules (verified via `./gradlew projects`)
- [x] Quarkus app boots — `GET /q/health` returns `200 { "status": "UP" }`; 6 @QuarkusTest assertions pass ([PR #110](https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately/pull/110))
- [x] Webapp boots — Vite dev, light/dark/system toggle, shadcn primitive, Lucide icons, 55 tests across 6 suites all green ([PR #111](https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately/pull/111))
- [x] `.github/workflows/` — ci-backend, ci-webapp, link-checker, codeql, release, pages, dependabot (all triggered and green on recent PRs)
- [x] `.github/` templates — PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md + ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug,feature,question}.yml + config.yml
- [x] `docs/` GitHub Pages landing (`index.html` + `README.md`) + `self-hosting/hardening.md` placeholder
- [x] `.claude/commands/` — `/new-phase`, `/release`, `/check-pr`, `/dogfood-strings`
- [x] `git init` + initial commit + push to `https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately`
- [x] Branch protection on `master` — PR required, CODEOWNERS review, signed commits, linear history, no force push, conversation resolution
- [x] CHANGELOG `[0.0.1]` final entry + RELEASE-NOTES narrative ([PR #113](https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately/pull/113))
- [x] Tag `v0.0.1` GPG-signed → [release.yml](https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately/actions/runs/24585357185) fires → [GitHub Release v0.0.1](https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately/releases/tag/v0.0.1) published as prerelease with backend fastjar + webapp bundle assets

### Verification (Phase 0 smoke)

```bash
docker compose up -d                                # postgres, redis, minio, mailpit
./gradlew build                                     # all modules compile
./gradlew :backend:app:quarkusDev &                 # boot Quarkus in dev
sleep 15 && curl -s http://localhost:8080/q/health | jq .
pnpm --filter webapp install
pnpm --filter webapp build                          # clean production bundle
```

Pass criteria: docker containers healthy; `./gradlew build` green; `/q/health` returns UP; webapp bundle builds without error.

### Risks / notes

- Gradle + Quarkus + Kotlin multi-module boilerplate is the heaviest lift in Phase 0 — budget a full day for T008+T009.
- Signed commits require GPG key on the local machine; verify `git config commit.gpgsign` and a working signer before T015.

./gradlew test                                      # JUnit + Kotest + Testcontainers
pnpm --filter webapp test                           # Vitest + axe
pnpm --filter e2e test                              # Playwright end-to-end

- [ ] "Suggest" per cell + "Translate selected" batch
- [ ] E2E: zero providers configured → "Suggest" UI absent, app fully usable

### Verification

```bash
# Settings: no AI configured → "Suggest" buttons absent, app fully usable
# Settings: configure Anthropic key → "Suggest" appears → click → state=MACHINE_TRANSLATED
# Add similar key → TM panel suggests prior translation
```

### Deliverables (high level)

- [ ] Outgoing webhooks (HMAC, retries, delivery log)
- [ ] CDN bundles → S3 signed URLs, content-hash versioned
- [ ] `@translately/cli` + GitHub Action wrapper
- [ ] `@translately/react` SDK
- [ ] Glossaries (terminology tables + AI prompt injection)

### Verification

```bash
# Configure webhook → edit translation → webhook.site receives HMAC-signed POST
# Configure CDN → fetch JSON via signed S3 URL
# CLI: translately push / pull against running stack
```

---

## Phase 7 — Tasks + Branching + SSO/SAML/LDAP + Audit + Polish → v1.0.0 ⚪

### Deliverables (high level)

- 2026-04-17: **T009 merged** ([PR #110](https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately/pull/110)). Quarkus application runs end-to-end: `/q/health`, `/q/health/live|ready|started`, `GET /` service metadata, `/q/openapi`, `/q/swagger-ui`. 6 @QuarkusTest assertions green. Fixed ktlint, CodeQL JS/TS gate, lychee forward-URL exclude list; split Quarkus convention plugin into app + library flavors.

CHANGELOG `[0.0.1]` + RELEASE-NOTES narrative + version bump from 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT to 0.0.1 (gradle.properties, root package.json, webapp/package.json). Lychee future-URL regex widened to cover `v0.0.1...master`.
- 2026-04-17: **T018 done — v0.0.1 shipped 🟢.** GPG-signed tag pushed ([v0.0.1](https://github.com/Pratiyush/translately/releases/tag/v0.0.1)). release.yml workflow completed green. GitHub Release published as prerelease. 11 stale dependabot PRs (#98–#109) triaged and closed with a "re-raise if still relevant after Phase 1" note.

**Phase 0 retrospective.** 2-day bootstrap (vs. 2-day target). All 18 tickets closed. 4 feat/fix/chore/docs PRs merged (#110, #111, #112, #113) each with CI green and GPG-signed commits. 55 webapp tests + 6 backend tests cover the runtime pipeline end-to-end.
